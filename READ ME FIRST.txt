Nothing much complicated about this game

1. Open The Program
2. Press "R" key to select "Rock", "S" for "Scissors" and "P" for "Paper"
3. Press "Esc" key to exit the program
4. Program will only respond to these 4 keys nothing else 

So you can do whatever you want in your PC even while the program is running in the background. The program will not affect anything you type anywhere else.
(Except for ESC key of course, it will simply end the program.)
 Totally Safe and a cute little Python Game.
Thank You and Enjoy
