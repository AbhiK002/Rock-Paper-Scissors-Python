    - N (for normal)
    - I (for Impossible)

5. Press SPACEBAR to change difficulty (start a new series)
6. Once you press SPACEBAR, before clearing the screen to ask for the new difficulty, it will print the details of the current series you were playing.
    - You can press SPACEBAR again to move on after viewing the results!
7. Press ESCAPE key anytime to end and exit the game

You can do whatever you want in your PC even while the program is running in the background. The program will not affect anything you type anywhere else.
